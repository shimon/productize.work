[The overall responsibility](/definitions/overarching) of product management is making the right product; i.e. one that is desirable, feasible, and viable.

This responsibility is sometimes clearly owned by someone with *Product Manager* in their job title. Other times it is owned by an exec or founder or designer, or shared among many people. While [there are some reasons to concentrate this responsibility in one person](/team/should-product-management-be-concentrated-or-shared), the work always requires synthesizing information from many sources including engineers.

### What to look for

From an engineer's perspective, these are the signals that you have a healthy product management function in your team:

* **Work prioritization and resource commitment is clear.** If nothing else, guidance on what to build and how much to invest has to be specific. If you can't get or create this, your best possible outcome is random sprawl. The likely outcome is inaction.

* **The connection between work and value is strengthening.** Early on in a project, you may be trying a lot of things that won't work out. You usually don't start with a great understanding of what work is most valuable, but you *do* need to advance this knowledge rapidly.

  * *Ungrounded guessing* is a poor method of product management, just as random search is a poor method of finding a value in an array. Good product learning will feel more like binary search, where there may be some big jumps early on but focus narrows quickly.
  * But cut yourselves some slack, because *the unknowns are massive*. The job is "figure out the most valuable thing we could make" which is way more open-ended than many hard engineering problems.

* **Engineering isn't the only way you test for value.** Shipping a feature can be an accurate way to test if that feature is valuable, but it's not the only way, and it's *expensive.* Especially so when you're considering several divergent directions. The right [research techniques](/research/what-techniques) vary depending on your questions and resources, but healthy projects always deploy a variety of them. User interviews, sales feedback, competitive analysis, advertising tests, etc. all have their place in vetting potential work before you start coding.

### Product Management vs. Engineering

The state of software investment today is heavily speculative; even in big smart companies, lots of the stuff they build doesn't succeed. It's helpful to understand when a project is succeeding or failing because of product management versus because of engineering.

The *engineering* of a project is successful when, given a prioritized pile of work, the engineers can estimate that work (i.e. reasonably assess its cost and risk profile) and then implement that work at a cost consistent with the estimate.

The *product management* of a project is successful when the project meets the ROI expectations of its investors/sponsors.

For example, suppose PM says to eng "I want a flying car":

* If eng says "we can build that in 2 weeks for $10k no problem" and fails, that's an engineering failure because their estimate was ridiculous.
* If eng says "we have no clue how to do that" and PM says "screw you do it by Monday", that's a PM failure because they've neglected feasibility.
* If eng says "that could take 2-10 years and cost $1-10B" and PM says "that's too much, what can we do this month" and they figure out that putting racing stripes on a used Prius will basically work, then that's a *big win* for everyone.

### Responsibility vs. Role

It's important to point out that the responsibilities of product management don't necessarily rest on a person with that job title. Often engineers do a lot of product management work, simply by virtue of having to decide how they spend their time.

As when engineers design UI, this approach gets varied results. Sometimes you develop a great connection between related functions, other times you get garbage on both sides.

But many great product leaders come from an engineering background. Read about [making the transition from engineer to product manager](/team/engineer-to-product-manager).
