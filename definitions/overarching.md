What is product management? It's not too complicated:

## Make the right product.

Let's disassemble:

* **make**: you're going to create something
* **the right**: it's not obvious what it needs to be, and you'll take responsibility for figuring that out
* **product**: it will be a structured, repeatable thing for users.

Product management (the responsbility, not the job title) is not about managing a product team. It's not a sales, marketing, engineering, or design responsibility. But it entails some understanding of those jobs because good products have to designed, engineered, marketed, and sold. Sometimes PM is described as the glue across all these functions, but the core responsibility is not about coordination (that's pro*ject* management).

The core is figuring out a product that is **desirable, feasible, and viable.**

Usually we have guesses about the right product, but we're far from certain. Be wary of people who think a product messiah will appear and lead your wayward gang to success. Success comes from seeking opportunity/risk and learning quickly. You can't learn much if you're convinced you already know the answers.

### Desirable

Your product has to be something people want. Most failed products get this part wrong; they're embodiments of a theory of what people might want, but the theory is wrong, or people don't want it more than the alternatives. You don't hear a lot about failures of desirability, because the fate of these products is obscurity. But that's the default fate of any product, so you should worry about it.

### Feasible

You have to be able to make the thing. Everybody wants flying cars, unlimited leisure time, and the world's hottest girl/boyfriend. If you can make these let me know. More realistically, your team has to deploy its skills to prove *something* before you run out of resources. You'll be forced to prioritize.

### Viable

The product has to provide an acceptable return on investment. Many parodies of startups lampoon the attitude that "we lose money on every unit, but make it up in volume". But because viability is affected both by costs and investor expectations, it can be hard to gauge. For a long time many people thought Amazon was unviable, but now most believe it is. Right now many people think Uber is viable, but I'm not so sure.
